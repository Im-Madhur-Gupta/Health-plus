### Our Idea -

* The main idea is to reduce the time it takes to provide medical help during accidents or other medical emergencies by digitizing procedures like identifying hospitals, informing family members, and informing hospitals for patients in advance.
* Our app will automatically fill hospital OPD forms during emergencies for registered users with the data they filled during signing up.
* Our app will keep track of your medical history, which would enable us to instantly connect your details with the hospital so that your doctor can refer them in an organized fashion.
